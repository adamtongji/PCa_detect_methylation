## PCa early stage and metastasis diagnosis by cfDNA methylation


### Description
This folder contains scripts for the manuscript "Detection of prostate cancer occurrence and metastasis by cfDNA methylation signatures", including cfDNA methylation preprocssing wdl pipeline and codes for publication results preparation.

The modelling scripts applied in this manuscript were adapted from two previous paper: <br>
- Deep models: "DISMIR: Deep learning-based noninvasive cancer detection by integrating DNA sequence and methylation information of individual cell-free DNA reads. BIB. 2021",[source code](https://github.com/XWangLabTHU/DISMIR)
- Machine learning models: "Detection and characterization of lung cancer using cell-free DNA fragmentomes. Nature Commun. 2021",[source code](https://github.com/cancer-genomics/reproduce_lucas_wflow)
