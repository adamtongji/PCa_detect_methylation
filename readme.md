## PCa early stage and metastasis diagnosis by cfDNA methylation


### Description
This folder contains scripts for the manuscript "Detection of prostate cancer occurrence and metastasis by cfDNA methylation signatures", including cfDNA methylation analysis wdl pipeline and R data analysis code.

The modelling scripts applied in this manuscript were adapted from two previous paper: <br>
